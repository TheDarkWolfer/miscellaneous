Miscellaneous scripts, programs and all that I wish to share

### Contents

- battery.sh : A wrapper script that lets you display the battery level and state in a few ways (requires nerd fonts)
- usb-menu.sh : `USBGuard` script that lets you select which device to allow / block through a menu

##### PGP Key
My public PGP key, for everyone interested in contacting me or verifying any files I provide signed.
